# Used Car Price Forecasting via Multiple Linear Regression

A machine learning project to forecast used car prices using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

## Project Overview

This project applies Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict the Prices of used cars based on various features such as Age, Total Kilometers driven (KM), Fuel type, Horsepower (HP), Engine capacity (CC), Transmission type (Automatic), Number of doors, Number of Cylinders, Number of Gears, and Weight of the car.

The goal is to analyze factors influencing car prices and build a regression model that can forecast prices effectively.

## Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summaries

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots & pairplots

Model Building

Implement Multiple Linear Regression

Model Evaluation (RÂ², MSE, RMSE)

Check assumptions (multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals)

Insights



## Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

Age: Age of the car (in years)

KM:  Total kilometers driven

FuelType: Type of fuel (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)

HP: Horsepower

Automatic: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)

CC: Engine capacity

Doors: Number of doors

Cylinders: Number of cylinders

Gears: Number of gears

Weight: Car weight

Price: Target variable (used car price)

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Scikit-learn & Statsmodels â€“ Model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook â€“ Interactive development

 ## Results

Built a regression model explaining the relationship between car features and price.

Identified Age, KM, and weight as major influencing factors.

Achieved a good fit with RÂ² and RMSE, validating the effectiveness of MLR.
